<!-- Take a look at `*/public/js/members.js*`
   and you will be able to understand what you need 
   in order to get the user information. 
   Sequelize automatically creates an `id` for a user 
   so you can use it to handle associations on other tables in the database.
   
   If for example you are looking to authenticate on a classified website 
   all you will have to make sure is to have a model such as posting to insert into database, 
   api route to do the post, html route to GET page before and after Post to the database. 
   
   Always make sure you pass `isAuthenticated` on any html route 
   that you do not want the user to access without logging in. 
   `isAuthenticated` will always check for access if used.

I hope my very literal explanation is able to help you figure 
out your authentication without the use of handlebars or MongoDB. -->
